
In generaly my convention is LH (+Z forward) and will adapted to the Vulkan context


Model -> World -> View -> Projection -> Clip -> NDC -> Framebuffer(Screen) -> shs::Canvas



Model space 3D coordinate system:
    origin is (0,0,0) and center of all vertices of individual model
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the forward



World space 3D coordinate system:
    origin is (0,0,0) and center of all models
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the forward



View space 3D coordinate system:
    origin is (0,0,0) and viewer (camera) is at origin, looking toward +Z
    all models are transformed into this coordinate system
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the forward



Projection space coordinate system:
    used for simulating camera perspective (left-handed)
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the forward
    w is used for perspective normalization



Clip space (homogeneous clip space):
    result of: clip = Projection * View * Model * vec4(position, 1)
    coordinates are still homogeneous (x, y, z, w)
    clipping happens against ±w



NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates):
    obtained by perspective divide:
        ndc = clip.xyz / clip.w

    x is mapped to range [-1.0, 1.0]
    y is mapped to range [-1.0, 1.0]
    z is mapped to range [ 0.0, 1.0]   // Vulkan uses zero-to-one depth
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the forward



Framebuffer / Screen space (Vulkan viewport space):
    NDC is transformed by Vulkan viewport into framebuffer coordinates
    origin (0,0) is at top-left corner
    x is from left to the right
    y is from top to the bottom
    rasterization happens in this space



shs::Canvas 2D coordinate system (logical space):
    origin (0,0) is at left-bottom corner
    x is from left to the right
    y is from bottom to up
    this is a logical coordinate system used by the renderer



Converting from Framebuffer(Screen) space to shs::Canvas space:
    x_at_canvas = x_at_framebuffer
    y_at_canvas = (FRAMEBUFFER_HEIGHT - 1) - y_at_framebuffer
